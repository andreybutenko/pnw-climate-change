Data Notes 

-GeoID is derived from the 5-digit Federal Information Processing Standards codes (FIPS codes) delineated by the National Institute of Standards 
 and Technology.  Region codes are created by the NOAA Office of Coastal Management. 

-Values of -9999 identify data that are suppressed. These data non-zero values but cannot be reported due to data confidentiality laws.

-Values of 0 are true zeros. They indicate that there was no economic activity in that particular industry or sector for that year.

-Ocean economy totals or all ocean sectors (Industry or sector totals) will not necessarily equal a computed sum of the sectors.
 This is because the reported ocean economy totals include values that may have been suppressed in the components that make up the total.

-Shore values of 1 indicate that a county as shore-adjacent.
-Shore values of 0 indicate that a county is not shore-adjacent.
