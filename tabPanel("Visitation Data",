       p("As you can see, our stat's visitation really increases during the summer. In an article on future park visitation and how it would be affected by climate change written by PLOS, they sugested that parks that would have increased due to climate change would have increased visitation while those that would become colder would suffer from lower visitation. So, interestingly, it seems that our parks would benefit from global warming at first. However, the study did mention there was a sharp decline in visitation after crossing 25 degrees celcius. So, at least until we hit that threshold, we could possibly have increased visitation in parks. Fisichelli, Nicholas A., Gregor W. Schuurman, William B. Monoham, and Pamela S. Ziesler.
